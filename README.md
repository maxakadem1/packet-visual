## Wireshark Data Visualisation using React with Mapbox, DeckGL, Bootstrap and Flask
![Packet Visual Banner](/public/packet-visual-banner.png)

**Packet Visual** is a data visualisation application for Wireshark. Its interface allows users to
upload their own .pcapng files after exporting and saving a capture from Wireshark. Uploaded
.pcapng files will be stored on the application, processed, parsed, and translated into a JSON
file which contains key packet information. Packet Visual will play the packets, revealing source
addresses over a time sequence and duration, as if executing network traffic in real-time. The
applicationâ€™s integration with a real world map using Mapbox and WebGL will connect packets
from a geographic source to destination for an immersive visualisation experience.
